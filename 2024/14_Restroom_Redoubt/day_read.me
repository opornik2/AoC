tags: grid points cycle movements (like on sphere), find active points(robots) in grid quadrants, find Easter Egg picture of X-mass tree
edge cases: Easter Egg not defined enough, how it looks like
problems: find the Easter Egg picture, first manually, then try to cheat a bit and put some answer to know is is lowe or bigger
improve:
algo: assumed the Easter Egg will be in the center and will have first or last column empty, then manually check only these pictures on grid (with success at 6668 iters.)
