tags: lists parsing, split numbers, list to dic conversion to avoid list growing
edge cases: list growing huge in part 2
problems: part1 easy with naive algo., part2 impossible to do the same way because of computing time+memory for quicly growing list. Wrote recursive part2 but this did not help. No idea how to improve it...
improve: to do, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursive-functions/ - not this way!, read @xavdid solution
algo: keeping number of each stone in a dictonary solved the problem definitely
