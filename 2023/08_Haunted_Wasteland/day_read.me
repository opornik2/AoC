tags: simple graph (no need to use libraries), regex parsing
edge cases: part2 has 6 parallel paths and so many steps to process that it would last many hours
problems: part2 should be done no in parallel like in instruction but one by one than use LCM function
improve: lcm(int, int,...) requires single integers but we have them in list - how to process such list?
algo: Least_Common_Multiple (najmniejsza wspólna wielokrotność)
