tags: matrix distances, expand list of lists
edge cases: expading each empty row/col 1 million times so the array will become huge and possibly OoM
problems: expand lines and columns of the matrix in a simply way (transpose)
improve:
algo: find empty rows/cols between galaxies and add distance instead of expand the list of lists
